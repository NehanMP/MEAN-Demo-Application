MEAN-Demo-Application

This project was created as an Internship recruited assigment at Heaven's Code, to showcase how the basic crud operations occur in a MEAN stack application. Data is passed from the frontend to the backend through api's where an interactive user interface was developed using Angular and the backend developed using Node and Express while using MongoDB as the database.
